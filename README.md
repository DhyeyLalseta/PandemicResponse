# PandemicResponse

Started as a project for Pandemic Response Hackathon. Attempting to create web app that can take address and display nearest 4-5 hospitals with details such as patient capacity, wait time and drive time. Planning to implement distance matrix from google maps API to gain real insight to drive times, etc. Currently running off fake data, not too much functionality. "Hospital Sign in" page is just default django admin page because I got too lazy lol sorry hopefully I fix it in the future. Results sort based on drive time.
If you want to try it out, download, create a virtual environment, install requirements (I'm pretty sure half of them aren't required but eh). Just follow https://coderwall.com/p/aykl2w/setup-an-existing-django-project honestly.
